Masamune sword mini-mini-quest

Its not a quest in that you have journal entries and gain XP but you do get one helluva sword 
When its all done.

Unzip the files, then use a either IEEP or IEES from TeamBG.com to unpack the tbg files into 
your BG2 overrides file.  place the cre, bcs, and dlg flies into your override folder.  

Check the spoiler.txt file if you want to know what the items are and where they're to be found.
Othewise, lets just say the observant should get it anyway, and what Ive done is placed three 
Items on NPC's that are encountered and subsequently killed by you.  They drop these items.  Two 
are in the SoA portion of the game, one in the ToB portion.  The two in SoA cna be upgraded by 
Crowell to be one, better item.  this Item can be combined with the one found in ToB by 
Cespenar to be one BIG POWERFULL WEAPON, BWA HA HA HA!!  whoa, dont know what came over me.

Oh, yeah and just for fun...  I'll email a 'Pile of Endless Riches' (to be used in the game! I 
mean... c'mon, do I look rich to you?) to the first person who identifies the game that gave me 
the idea for these items.
