Ok, just too impatient to play the game, are you?  Want to know it ALL do you?  well fine!  these
are the items, where to find them, and what they make.

Masa +2: +2 Wakizashi; Kangaxx has it, you get it when you kill him
Mune +2: +2 Wakizashi; Mae'Var has it, kill him and its yours
Masamune +4: +4 Katana; Bring Masa and Mune to Cromwell and he'll forge the Masamune for you
Doreen +4: +4 Long Sword; Find her among Gromnir Il'Khan's remains
Mastermune +6: +6 Katana; Bring the Masamune and Doreen to Cespenar, and he'll make the Mastermune
Also, Kangaxx has a scroll, labeled 'Entry from Kangaxx's Journal' that gives a small hint to the
Location of Mune(If by some weird quirk of nature you killed Kangaxx BEFORE killing Mae'Var) And
something I threw in as to how the Elemental and Shade Liches could find one as powerful as 
Kangaxx when he was tring to hide himself.
