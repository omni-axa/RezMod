This is just a couple files for the override folder that give Anarg, the leader of the Fallen Paladins, a snazzy custom helmet that can be picked up by the player. 
It gives no AC bonus, but does give immunity to Charm, Hold, Fear, and Level Drain, 
thus covering a wide spectrum of the Paladin kit immunities.
This has the side effect of making Anarg tougher, as he's much harder to disable, but greater risk brings greater reward...
This was created with a version of BG2 with ToB installed, will most likely work with just SoA.
EDIT:This is an improved version of the item with its own description in your dialog.tlk. You will need TeamBG tools to import it.
Anarg himself (KAYPAL01.cre) can simply be copied to your Override folder.
